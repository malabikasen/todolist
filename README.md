A To-Do List Single Page Application built using the MERN stack - Express, Mongo DB and Node.js


## Motivation


I wanted to learn Full-Stack Web Development in Javascript and a simple To-Do List app with basic CRUD functionalities - adding a task, reading all the to-do tasks, updating the tasks and deleting the tasks - sounded great to me as this serves as an MVP.

## Technology Stack


I used the MERN stack (without react, for now) to build my Single Page Application (SPA). For those who are not well-versed with the acronym, MERN stands for Mongo DB, Express, React and Node.js.


The application uses Express to create a RESTful API which would help with the CRUD operations. Mongo DB was used as a database to persist the tasks. Node.js was used to serve the application on the internet.
